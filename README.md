# ROS simulation robot senarios
This repository presents the 3D modeling and implementation of the Mechatron educational platform using educational scenarios in the ROS simulation environment. The aim is to establish a methodology for the operation and simulation of sensors, actuators, and other objects within ROS software. The steps outlined in this thesis can be used to utilize the Mechatron robot for educational purposes or serve as a reference for developing and designing new robotic systems. This was achieved through conducting various training scenarios and providing guidance on handling scenarios that mainly focused on sensors and additional components that can be integrated into the Mechatron robotic model.
